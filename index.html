<br>
<br>
<br>For reporting price changes, <a href="https://sushiswep.github.io/" class="text-primary">SushiSwap</a> utilizes a number of decentralized oracles. The list includes SushiSwap's TWAP oracle as well as Compound's Open Price feed, as well as oracles built by Chainlink. Additionally, arbitrageurs help in delivering precise prices' by minimizing price variations across every trading pair.

<br>What is Sushiswap Exchange?
<br>
<br>SushiSwap is an exchange decentralized that handles yield farming and token swaps via the use of an Automated Market Maker (AMM) smart contract. Based on Ethereum this exchange is a more advanced version of the Sushiswap Protocol as well as a second DEX using the same AMM system.
<br>
<br>
<br>The exchange financially rewards liquidity providers to provide tokens onto the exchange by providing them with fees. Particularly, they receive the cost that other traders have to pay for token swaps.
<br>
<br>
<br>To provide price changes, <a href="https://sushiswep.github.io/" class="text-primary">SushiSwap</a> utilizes a number of decentralized oracles. The list includes SushiSwap's TWAP oracle, Compound's open Price feed, as well as oracles developed by Chainlink. In addition, arbitrageurs help in delivering exact prices' by reducing the price variances on every trading pair.
<br>
<br>
<br>As of this writing, SushiSwap sits at number six on the DeFi Pulse leaderboard. It hosts an aggregate of $3.69 billion of collateralized assets. However the biggest competitor Sushiswap is fifth on the list and holds $3.97 billion.
<br>
<br>
<br>The DEX has a large part of its success to savvy and strategic thinking. Through introducing superior features to their rivals, SushiSwap reached more than $1.6 billion in liquid assets in just one month. But since the features were only temporary as was the platform's popularity. Certain controversies did not aid either and SushiSwap changed from being DeFi's top project to the most unpopular.
<br>
<br>
<br>This meant that nobody wanted to alter this protocol over the course of months. It wasn't until the new developers started developing <a href="https://sushiswep.github.io/" class="text-primary">SushiSwap</a> to make the swap more secure that it was able to gain the trust of the community.
<br>
<br>
<br>SushiSwap Exchange SushiSwap Exchange allows users to swap any ERC20 token for any other token ERC20 using automatic liquidity pools. The Swap page is an example. It was only when new developers started developing SushiSwap when the swap was able to win back the trust of the community.&nbsp;<br></p>
